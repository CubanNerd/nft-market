                    <strong>Natur Dreamscapes</strong> is an exploration of shared dreams between a human and an AI.  As a designer, a tech enthusiast and a scifi fan, I’ve become fascinated with the potencial of AI. I’ve been utilizing it as a visual notebook or a visual journal for my day dreams. This collection is an visual representation of some the places I visit in my head during the day whenever I need to get away from reality.

                    AI image generation is sometimes called dreaming and I do find the term very appropiate. I decided to combine both my dreams and the AI’s interpretation of them and share them with you with this collection.
